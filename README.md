Play games from a single bookmarklet!

## What is it?
Games In A Bookmark is a bookmarklet that- when activated- overwrites the content of the current webpage with a game dashboard. From there, users can access games that were copied in from web-based game sites such as Poki. All games will be added manualy, but coders can also create their own games with HTML, CSS, and JS.

## How do you get it?
You can add Games In A Bookmark by dragging the "Games In A Bookmark" button to your bookmarks bar.
<button>Games In A Bookmark</button>

## The game I want isn't here!
If the game you want is not yet added, open an issue. Your game will likely be added in the next update.

## Can I make games for Games In A Bookmark?
You can make games for Games In A Bookmark! I am not yet sure how I want games to be formated (I am making this readme before anything else) but you can start making a game with HTML, JS, and CSS.
